### Notes
I had difficulties getting the correct constraints on the launch screen, but was able to get them right by using multiple phones to demo the changes. Also, while trying to run my app on my iPhone, I realized that I don't have iTunes downloaded and have no space to download it again, so I was unable to run it on my own app.
